# Analysis of Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple algorithm to sort a finite sequence of a totally ordered set.

In each pass of a bubble sort, for each pair of adjacent positions of the sequence from the left to the right, we compare the elements at these positions and swap them if and only if they are out of order.

To analyze bubble sort of a randomly shuffled sequence, as well as to compare its versions, we focus mainly on the following terms:

- the distribution of the number of the passes

- the distribution of the number of the comparisons in each pass

- the distribution of the number of the swaps in each pass
