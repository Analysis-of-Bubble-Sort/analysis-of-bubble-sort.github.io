Each finite sequence of a totally ordered set will be bubble sorted in finite passes.

The number of the necessary passes is no more than the length of the sequence.

The rightest swap in a pass is lefter and lefter.

There exists a positive integer $i$ that $a^{i}_{1}, a^{i}_{2}, \cdots, a^{i}_{n}$ is in order.

There exists a positive integer $i$ that $a^{i}_{1}, a^{i}_{2}, \cdots, a^{i}_{n}$ is in order and $i \le n$.
