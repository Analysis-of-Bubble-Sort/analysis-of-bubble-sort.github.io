# Introduction

Bubble sort is a simple algorithm to sort a finite sequence of a totally ordered set.

In each pass of a bubble sort, for each pair of adjacent positions of the sequence from the left to the right, we compare the elements at these positions and swap them if and only if they are out of order.
