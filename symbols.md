$a$ is a finite sequence of a totally ordered set.

$a_{k}$ is the element at the $k$-th leftest position of $a$.

$\min \left( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{k} \right)$ is the leftest one of the minimum elements of $\left( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{k} \right)$.

$\max \left( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{k} \right)$ is the rightest one of the maximum elements of $\left( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{k} \right)$.

$a^{i}$ is the sequence before the $i$-th pass.

$a^{i, j}$ is the sequence before the $j$-th comparison in the $i$-th pass.
